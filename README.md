# [JG | Terminal](https://jg-term.deno.dev/)

## My attempt on a terminal style website 
<br/>

### Tech used
- Deno (https://deno.land/) 
- Fresh (https://fresh.deno.dev/)
<br/><br/>

### Quick Start

```
deno task start
```

This will watch the project directory and restart as necessary.
<br /><br />

## Notes
- Still a little buggy on firefox for focusing the input and mobile doesn't work.
- Arrow up and down for history needs better implementation.
- Will eventually make modular for anyone to use with a simple `config.json`.
